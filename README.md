Please implement a simple website using any modern framework(we use ReactJS so extra points), that would allow displaying Github user's public repositories.
The main page should have an input and allow a user to enter Github's username. The second page would display available repositories, and the thrid page would display README.md content of the selected respository. 

As a result you can either zip with the project or send the link to a git repository. Please provide instructions how to run the project.

Don't bother with design. Here are main criterias for project evaluation:
1) Project's structure, used tools
2) Test coverage
3) Any other good practices.

Please implement a simple website using ReactJS that would allow displaying Github user's public repositories.
The main page should have an input and allow a user to enter Github's username. The second page would display available repositories, and the thrid page would display README.md content of the selected respository. 

Don't bother with design. Here are main criterias for project evaluation:
1) Project's structure, used tools
2) Test coverage
3) Any other good practices.

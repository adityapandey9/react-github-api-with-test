Please implement a simple website using ReactJS + Typescript, that would allow displaying Github user's public repositories.
The main page should have an input and allow a user to enter Github's username. The second page would display available repositories for the entered user, and the thrid page would display the list of files in the repo + README.md content of the selected respository.

As a result you can either zip with the project or send the link to a git repository. Please provide instructions how to run the project.

Don't bother with design. Here are main criterias for project evaluation:

1. Code quality
2. Using the best practices
3. Project structure
4. Test coverage
5. Any other good practices.
